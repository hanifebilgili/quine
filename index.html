<h1>The Amazing Philosophy of Williard van Orman Quine</h1>
<img id="image1" src="./resources/images/Quine1.jpg" alt="">
<p>Willard Van Orman Quine (1908-2000) worked in theoretical philosophy and in logic. (In practical philosophy—ethics and political philosophy—his contributions are negligible.) He is perhaps best known for his arguments against Logical Empiricism (in particular, against its use of the analytic-synthetic distinction). This argument, however, should be seen as part of a comprehensive world-view which makes no sharp distinction between philosophy and empirical science, and thus requires a wholesale reorientation of the subject.</p>

<p>Or if you had a hard time understanding what Quine had to say in the field of ontology, and you do not want him to rest in peace, you can also tell the world how you feel about him by typing in the box below.</p>

    <p>Quine published a book titled <i>From a Logical Point of View</i> in 1953. In a personal interview he says he chose the title from a song popular at that time which has the lyrics "from my personal point of view". <br> If you like to listen to the song please click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1ZJiBHh-Yw">here</a>.

    <p>and finally here is a quote by Quine which in my opinion not only vocalizes his views on ontology but also on epistemology.</p>
